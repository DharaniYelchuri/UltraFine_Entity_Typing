# ðŸ“˜ A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF INDIRECT SUPERVISION TECHNIQUES FOR ULTRA-FINE ENTITY TYPING

## ðŸ“Œ PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project aims to **EVALUATE** and **COMPARE** the performance of three different **INDIRECT SUPERVISION** approaches for the task **ULTRA-FINE ENTITY TYPING (UFET)**.  
The approaches studied are:  
- **LITE (LANGUAGE INFERENCE BASED TYPING OF ENTITIES)**  
- **MASKED LANGUAGE MODELING (MLM)**  
- **DISTANT SUPERVISION**

The primary goal is to **UNDERSTAND HOW EACH METHOD PROCESSES DATA** and to **ANALYZE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS** in terms of **ACCURACY**, **EFFICIENCY**, and other **RELEVANT METRICS**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVES
- **IMPLEMENT** three **INDIRECT SUPERVISION** methods.  
- **EVALUATE** their performance on a **COMMON DATASET**.  
- **COMPARE** results based on **ACCURACY, EFFICIENCY, AND ROBUSTNESS**.  
- **ANALYZE** strengths and weaknesses of each method.

## ðŸ“‚ METHODS COMPARED
### ðŸ”¹ **LITE (LANGUAGE INFERENCE BASED TYPING OF ENTITIES)**
- Uses **TEXTUAL INFERENCE** to predict entity types.  
- Relies on **NATURAL LANGUAGE INFERENCE MODELS**.  

### ðŸ”¹ **MASKED LANGUAGE MODELING (MLM)**
- Exploits **PRETRAINED TRANSFORMERS**.  
- Predicts masked words to infer **ENTITY TYPES**.  

### ðŸ”¹ **DISTANT SUPERVISION**
- Uses **EXISTING KNOWLEDGE BASES** for labeling.  
- Provides **WEAKLY LABELED DATA** for training.
